"""Pin the cross-file agreements [#90](https://github.com/mshamblin5150-code/clinical-skills/issues/90) settled.

**Every defect this file guards is one document contradicting another**, which is
the shape #90 turned out to be twice over. ``batch-shift``'s ``description`` said
the input was a pasted shift while the first third of the same file opened a PDF;
and ``setup-clinical-skills`` kept the unmapped-preceptor sentence
[#91](https://github.com/mshamblin5150-code/clinical-skills/pull/91) had already
retired in ``batch-shift``, so for four days two skills stated one rule at
different strengths.

**Different strengths, not opposite ones, and the distinction is the finding.**
The retired sentence -- *reported, never substituted* -- was **stricter** than
what replaced it, and both forbid an agent guessing a surname. What #91 separated
out was the clinician's own deliberate substitution, which the old wording swept
in alongside the guess. A reader of ``setup-clinical-skills`` alone would not have
done anything unsafe; they would have refused something that was not theirs to
refuse. **Calling it a contradiction overstates it**, and this paragraph said so
before a review caught it.

**A single-file reader cannot see either.** Both read as coherent on their own
page, which is why they survived a review that opened one file at a time and why
the check has to name pairs rather than rules.

There is nothing to run here and no scanner to keep parity with -- this is
``test_spelling_scan.py``'s *the scanner must not drift from the file a reader
opens*, with the second reader being another Markdown file rather than a tool.

**Substrings, deliberately, and phrased as the ruling rather than as the
sentence.** A test asserting a paragraph verbatim fails on every rewrite and
teaches the next session to delete it; these assert the load-bearing clause, so
the prose around them stays free.
