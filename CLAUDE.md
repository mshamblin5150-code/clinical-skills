See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the skill index and the standing rules that bind every skill in this repo.

## Agent skills

Configuration for the maintainer's engineering skills. **None of this is required to use the clinical skills** — consumers read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and need nothing else, with no plugin to install.

### Issue tracker

GitHub issues on `mshamblin5150-code/clinical-skills`, via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical roles, kept at their default strings. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context — `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root, created lazily by `/domain-modeling` rather than scaffolded upfront. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

## Maintainer tooling

Also not required to use the clinical skills, and deliberately not cited from [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — a consumer needs the Markdown and nothing else.

### Corpus census

Several claims in [clinical-note](skills/clinical-note/SKILL.md) are counts over the clinician's shorthand corpus, and rulings have turned on them. `tools/corpus_census.py` recomputes all of them:

```bash
python tools/corpus_census.py
```

It reads `scratch/day-file-text/` — gitignored PHI — and **prints counts only, never matched text**, so its output is safe to paste into a ticket. Run it before relying on a figure again, and whenever the corpus grows.

Its extractors are covered by `tools/test_corpus_census.py`, which runs against the committed PHI-free fixtures and never touches `scratch/`:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tools -t tools
```

Stdlib only — no package manager, no lockfile, no CI in this repo, and the census is not worth introducing any.

**Known open disagreement.** On its first run the census landed at 521/559 carrying an age or a date of birth (93%), against the 529 and "about 95%" currently written into `clinical-note`. Tracked as [issue #9](https://github.com/mshamblin5150-code/clinical-skills/issues/9) — unresolved, so treat both figures as in question.

### PHI pre-commit hook

Standing rule 1 is enforced rather than remembered. **Git does not clone hooks, so every clone needs this once:**

```bash
git config core.hooksPath tools/hooks
```

After that, `tools/hooks/pre-commit` runs `tools/phi_scan.py` on every commit in that clone — yours, an agent's, anything.

**Two layers, and the asymmetry between them is the design.**

- **Corpus layer** — every patient name and date literal appearing in `scratch/`. **No file can exempt itself from this.**
- **Shape layer** — things that look like PHI whatever the corpus says: a `dob` token followed by a date, SSN, phone, MRN plus digits, a `2-30-99`-style date. ISO dates are deliberately not flagged, since the skill files are full of `measured 2026-08-11`.

A file that genuinely needs PHI-shaped literals — `tools/test_corpus_census.py` tests a date-of-birth extractor — declares `phi-scan: synthetic` near its top. **That exempts the shape rules only.** A file may say its dates are invented; no file may say its patient names are fine.

Findings are redacted by default so hook output is safe to paste. Reveal them with:

```bash
python tools/phi_scan.py --show
```

Audit everything already committed with `python tools/phi_scan.py --all`.

**What this does not do.** It is a seatbelt, not a vault:

- `git commit --no-verify` bypasses it, as it bypasses any hook.
- The corpus layer needs `scratch/` present. On a fresh clone it finds nothing and only the shape layer remains.
- A patient name that appears nowhere in the corpus and is not date-shaped is caught by neither layer. All PHI here originates in the corpus, so the hole is narrow — but it is real, and it is why the rule still has to be read.
